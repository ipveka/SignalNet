# Data Quality & Validation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses essential data quality issues in SignalNet: duplicate timestamps, missing values, and basic validation to ensure reliable model training.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Data Validation

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want basic data validation to catch common data issues, so that model training doesn't fail unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading CSV data THEN the system SHALL validate that required columns exist (series_id, timestamp, value)
2. WHEN loading CSV data THEN the system SHALL check for duplicate timestamps per series
3. WHEN loading CSV data THEN the system SHALL validate that values are numeric
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL raise clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Missing Data Handling

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want simple missing value handling, so that I can work with real-world datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering missing values THEN the system SHALL provide forward fill and interpolation options
2. WHEN missing values are handled THEN the system SHALL log the number of values processed
3. WHEN applying strategies THEN the system SHALL maintain timestamp order and series integrity
